								<h2>Hey there! I'm Anu</h2>
								<p class="space">I'm currently a rising senior at UCSB studying Computer Science. While most of my project and work experience has been in front end development, I'm always broadening my scope of knowledge with different backend languages. I've worked in full stack web development, iOS development and am currently working as an Android Development intern at Facebook. I've also enjoyed roles in which I got to interact directly with customers and work with them to make products that better fit their needs. My goal is to gain experience in both frontend and backend programming and eventually evolve into more product management roles. On the side, I'm a pretty big movie geek and an unofficial thai food connoisseur.</p>

								<p class = "smallP"> I worked on the Gmail Web team at Google in summer 2018. My project was around a feature that allowed better integration of Drive files and other shared files in Google Chat. I implemented a shared files tab that allowed users to easily access all shared files in any group chat or direct message. This feature was completely functional, with files being sorted and rendered in chronological order, and with the ability to open those files directly from the tab in Chat. Because this feature was new, I had a lot of control over the initial design of the prototype which I thoroughly enjoyed iterating through. Other than my main project, I also helped ship a badging feature that displayed the chat count when chat was collapsed.</p>

								<p class = "smallP"> I worked on the iOS team over the summer at Workday. On the iOS team, I worked on a feature that used optical character recognition to detect and verify necessary user information throughout the user's onboarding process. Doing this project allowed me to experiment with several frameworks/ML tools including Apple Vision, Core ML, Swift OCR, and Google MLKit. Later, I authored a casual article on benefits and pitfalls of different OCR platforms and frameworks on the iOS platform. Aside from my project, I got to work alongside the team on code reviews and bug fixes. I also had the opportunity to work with project managers and designers to fine tune aspects of my feature. </p>

								<p class = "smallP">At Novacoast, I worked on the “Full Resolution Health” project - a HIPAA compliant, cloud-based app used by four Autism clinics for over a year. The app helps parents/caretakers of the patients to share the patient’s videos with their doctors and actively exchange feedback. On Full Res, I worked on mockups for the iOS app and the scoring feature on the web app, which I then coded based on my iterated mockups. I worked alongside my team to design and onboard a new scoring feature that's currently on the product site.I'm currently working on the iOS app. I've also worked on some backend features for the admin tools and implemented Google Analytics which is used to track and strategize on the feature usage.</p>

										<br />
										<p class = "smallP">Cloud classroom was made to become a "virtual classroom". It simulates a classroom environment by making it easy for students to communicate with the teacher and goes a step further to allow nondistracting interactions between students. Teachers can host a class with a virtual whiteboard that students can see in real time (hosted on the AWW app). Teachers can also connect a twitch stream and host a chat room all in one page where students can join and interact with each other and teachers alike. The chat stream was written natively with node.js servers and differentiates student and teachers. It also has features that allow students to effectively queue questions directed at the teacher which the teacher can then address.</p>

										<br />
										<p class = "smallP">A camera that focuses on accessibility for the blind (irony intended). This was based off of the Microsoft question, how would you design X (usually Microsoft Excel, PPT etc.) for the blind, but after further inspection I realized there was no Android accessibility for the native camera app. The app uses Google ML Kit to recognize objects, and Google text to voice to read aloud what is seen, and speech to text to recognize commands like, “Take a picture” or "What am I looking at?".</p>

										<p class = "smallP">An android app that allows user to create/join rooms in realtime via Firebase realtime database. If a user decides to create a room, a 4 digit code is generated so that other users could join that room with no sign up necessary. Once a user joins a room, they can add watch and add Youtube videos to a queue. Other users in the room can upvote videos and the queue will be updated in realtime.</p>

										<p class = "smallP">An additional feature to Workday’s android app that used optical character recognition through Google MLKit to allow recruiters to scan resumes and parse viable information in real time. The feature also allowed recruiters to add notes, a scoring system, and team assignments to possible contenders. Recruiters could also create separate folders for different career fairs/schools/occupations <b>Placed in top 5 at Workday's Intern Hackathon</b></p>
